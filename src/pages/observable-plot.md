Observable Plot is a JavaScript visualisation library created by Mike Bostock, the creator of the <span class='internal-link'>[D3 library](d3js)</span>. It is based on the same concepts as <span class='internal-link'>[Vega](vega)</span>, and generates charts in SVG. It was developed to work well in the Observable interactive notebook environment, but is also available as a [standalone JavaScript library](https://github.com/observablehq/plot).
