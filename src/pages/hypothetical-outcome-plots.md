Understanding the results from a sample drawn from a population distribution is not very intuitive. Hypothetical outcome plots (HOPs) try to make this easier to grasp.

Instead of showing some summary statistics, like the sample mean and a confidence interval, HOPs simulate multiple samples from the same distribution, and show them in an animated way.

The animation of a HOP can give viewers an intuitive sense of the uncertainty surrounding the true trends.

The New York Times used some HOPs to simulate how the US Labor Departmentâ€™s monthly jobs report numbers would look like when resampled with the same sampling error the jobs report has. The results are quite striking.

When animated HOPs leave a trace, they can be used to build up a static image that shows the cumulative results of each frame of the HOP. An example of this technique is the animation in the [Extensive Data Shows Punishing Reach of Racism for Black Boys](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class-white-and-black-men.html) article by the New York Times. It shows how black boys who grew up rich have a higher chance to end up poor than their white peers.
