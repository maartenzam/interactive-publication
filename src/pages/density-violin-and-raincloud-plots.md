A **density plot** is a continuous and smoothed version of a histogram. The biggest advantage is that its shape does not depend on the number of buckets like the histogram does, because density plots donâ€™t use buckets.

Because density plots can be plotted on a single base line, they make comparing distributions easier than histograms.

When a density plot is mirrored and a box plot is overlaid, the result is often called a **violin plot** (which usually has a vertical orientation), or an **eye plot** (usually horizontal).

Another popular combination are density plots together with dot plots, or density plots together with jittered data points. This combination is called a **raincloud plot**.
