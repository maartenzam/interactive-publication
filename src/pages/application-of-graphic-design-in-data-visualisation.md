The design concepts of the grid and reading sequence have clear implications for the design of data visualisations. Here are some ground rules.

- Whenever you are using a layout or design tool to lay out elements, turn on the “**Show the grid**” option to position and size your elements. This applies both to positioning and sizing charts in a publication, as to positioning and sizing the building blocks of a visualisation. Turning on the “Snap to grid” option makes using the grid much easier.
- Align the **title** of your chart in the **top left** of your visualisation, to respect the reading order. The least important information should go in the bottom and could be right aligned to put it into the bottom-right corner
- To align a visualisation in a publication, you can use between many **anchor points** (the left edge of the y axis labels, the left edge of the plotting area, the left edge of the chart area). Choose the one that feels right and creates the best balance.
- **Align axis labels** both horizontally and vertically in a meaningful way
- Use an **invisible grid** and invisible boxes and frames. This means you shouldn’t put a frame around your visualisation when you embed it. The plotting area doesn’t need a border either (if needed, you could give it a subtle background color). In many cases, you can even remove the axis lines on a visualisation
- **Break the grid** to draw attention to a data visualisation or to individual data points or outliers
- Charts with a cartesian coordinate system, with an X and a Y axis, have a natural grid built into it. It shouldn’t be too visibly present (or should even be invisible), but you can use it to align chart elements like annotations
- Alignment and the grid are very important in table design. This is the topic of the [Table design](Table%20design%20fc020c95cbd840efb61aa1fdc6f6cb09.md) module.
- When laying out pages or when publications contain multiple visualisations, you need to consider the **reading sequence**, running from top-left to bottom-right.
