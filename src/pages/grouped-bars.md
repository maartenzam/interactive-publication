When data contains a secondary categorical breakdown, a bar chart can be turned into a **grouped bar chart**.

When the differences between the two groups are more important than the absolute values, it makes more sense to replace the grouped bar chart with a **dumbbell chart**. In a dumbbell chart, the values for the 2 groups are shown with a data mark (a circle or any other symbol), and the values are visually connected to highlight the differences between them.

In the case the 2 groups represent moments in time, the dumbbell can be replaced by an arrow showing the direction and magnitude of the trend. This results in an **arrow chart**.

When the number of groups is limited, grouped bar charts can work well. But when the number of groups grows, they become a lot harder to read.

In those cases, dot plots can provide a nice alternative.
