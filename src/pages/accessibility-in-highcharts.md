<p><span class='internal-link'><a href='highcharts'>Highcharts</a></span> is a JavaScript library to make a wide variety of charts and maps. To make Highcharts more accessible, Highcharts offers an <a href='https://www.highcharts.com/docs/accessibility/accessibility-module'>Accessibility module</a> (there are also additional modules to offer a link to download the data shown on a Highcharts visualisation).</p>

Some of the accessibility features in Highcharts are:

- add a text description of a chart and make it available to screen readers
- makes the data points in a visualisation and the chart menu navigable and interactable with a keyboard
