Data comes in the form of many types, and the types in your data will limit the options when it comes to chart types.

**Categorical data** is usually text based data that groups records in a dataset together, or that identifies each feature in a dataset. For example, the country names in a bar chart showing the cost of gasoline in the EU member states are categorical data.

Categorical data is also used to colour visual elements in a chart belonging to the same group. For example in the bubble chart below, the bubbles representing countries from the same region share their colour.

**Numerical data** is the most common data type in data visualisation. Numbers can be used to position, size and colour geometrical objects in a visualisation. In the bubble chart above, numerical data is used to position and size the bubbles.

Numerical data can be continuous or discrete. In continuous data, a data point can take any value, while in discrete numerical data the number of possible values is limited. Continuous data can be converted into discrete, binned values, as the following 2 maps illustrate. Binned numerical values behave very much like categorical data.

A very common type of data is **temporal data**, data containing information about a variable at different moments in time. Changes over time are usually visualised as line charts, with the x axis being the time axis, and time running from left to right.

**Geographical data** is any kind of data (categorical, numerical or temporal data, or a combination of these) that additionally contains information about geographical locations or entities. Geographical data can be used to make maps.
