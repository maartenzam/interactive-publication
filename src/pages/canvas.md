SVG is a handy and convenient format for data visualisation. But it also has limitations: when a visualisation contains thousands of elements, performance becomes an issue, and your browser will start to hang. This is especially true if the elements in the visualisation are animated, which requires a lot of computing power.

In situations like this, where SVG is not an option, you can consider using the [HTML `<canvas>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API). You can look at `<canvas>` as a bitmap image for which you compute the colour for each pixel dynamically with JavaScript. A deeper look at `<canvas>` would lead us too far, but below are some examples of visualisations that use it for data visualisation.
