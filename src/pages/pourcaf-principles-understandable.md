A visualisation makes no sense if it is only perceived but not understood. Making a chart more understandable can be done in many ways:

- Make it clear and explicit why a visualisation is shown to the viewer, and how it should be read, used and interpreted.
- The units the data is expressed in should be provided and should be unambiguous, and axes should be clearly labelled.

- The chart title should contain the take away message of the chart. Compare the “understandability” of the two charts below.

- The used text should be clear, and free from jargon and acronyms.
- Charts should not be overloaded. The number of data points and the number of different categories shouldn’t be too high.

- More complex charts, with unusual encodings or with more than 2 dimensions encoded, <span class='internal-link'>[need to be explained well](how-to-introduce-less-common-chart-types)</span>. The complexity of the visualisation can be built up in steps, explaining the encoding step by step.

- In interactive visualisations, changes in the visualisation should be easy to follow. When a change in the data or a change in the encoding is meaningful, changes should be animated.

- When there is uncertainty in the data, this should be clearly presented visually and explained in text. See <span class='internal-link'>[Visualising uncertainty](tag/visualising-uncertainty)</span>
