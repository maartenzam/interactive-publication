In a graphic sequence text blocks move over a fixed visual element in the background, which is replaced with a new graphic with each new text block.

Graphic sequences are often used for showing and highlighting information on a visualisation step by step. They can also work well with illustrations and photographs.

In graphic sequences, the transition between the subsequent graphics can be direct or can be faded. The graphic can use the full viewport or can have smaller dimensions. In the latter case, it is usually centered in the middle of the screen.
