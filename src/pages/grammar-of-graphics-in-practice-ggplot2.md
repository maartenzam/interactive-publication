## What is ggplot2?

[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is a package for the R programming language to make visualisations. It is based on the Grammar of Graphics: the ‚Äúgg‚Äù in the package‚Äôs name stands for Grammar of Graphics.

The ggplot2 package is part of an ecosystem of R packages that share the same philosophy and approach to working with data and making visualisations. This group of packages is called the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), and tidy data is a fundamental part of these packages, see <span class='internal-link'>[Intro to tidy data](intro-to-tidy-data)</span>.

ggplot2 was developed by statistician Hadley Wickham, and for many R users the package has replaced the native plotting functionality built into the R language.

## Getting started with ggplot2

In order to make visualisations with ggplot2, you need an environment to write and run R code. For this tutorial there are 2 options to do so.

The first option is to download and install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). RStudio is an application that was developed to make working with R code easy. It is an integrated development environment (IDE), which means it does things like managing your files, viewing data tables and visualisations and detecting errors in your code.

To use RStudio, you need to install R first. You can [download R from this page](https://cran.rstudio.com/). Once R is installed on your computer, you can [download RStudio from this page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) and install it too.

If you can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to install new programs on your computer, you can use [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/). RStudio Cloud is an online version of RStudio which runs in your browser. To use RStudio, the only thing you have to do is to create a (free) account for it. You can [create an account for RStudio on this page](https://rstudio.cloud/plans/free).

Once RStudio is installed and opened, or when you have logged into RStudio Cloud and created a first work space on it, you will see the RStudio interface.

![Screenshot of the RStudio interface](Grammar%20of%20Graphics%20in%20practice%20ggplot2%203d76e378b4bf4c6aa5886f4e622358b3/rstudio-interface.png)

The RStudio interface is divided into 4 main panels. The panel in the top left is called the source, and this is where you write and edit R scripts.

![The RStudio interface with the source pane highlighted in red](Grammar%20of%20Graphics%20in%20practice%20ggplot2%203d76e378b4bf4c6aa5886f4e622358b3/rstudio-interface-source.png)

If the source pane is not visible initially, you can click File > New file > R script, or click the green ‚Äú+‚Äù button and select ‚ÄúR script‚Äù to open a new empty R script in the source pane. You can have multiple R scripts open simultaneously, because the source pane uses tabs. The source pane is also used to preview data.

In the top right, you will find the environment pane.

![The RStudio interface with the environment pane highlighted in red](Grammar%20of%20Graphics%20in%20practice%20ggplot2%203d76e378b4bf4c6aa5886f4e622358b3/rstudio-interface-environment.png)

Source: Maarten Lambrechts, CC BY SA 4.0

In the environment pane you will find an overview of all the objects currently loaded in your R session. It also contains a history of all the commands you have previously run, and a wizard for importing data (click ‚ÄúImport Dataset‚Äù for this).

In the bottom left, you will find the console pane.

![The RStudio interface with the console pane highlighted in red](Grammar%20of%20Graphics%20in%20practice%20ggplot2%203d76e378b4bf4c6aa5886f4e622358b3/rstudio-interface-console.png)

In the console you can type in R commands and run them by pressing enter. Any output will also be displayed in the console, just like any errors and warnings resulting from running commands.

Finally, in the bottom right, you will find the pane to manage your files and R packages.

![The RStudio interface with the pane for files and packages highlighted in red](Grammar%20of%20Graphics%20in%20practice%20ggplot2%203d76e378b4bf4c6aa5886f4e622358b3/rstudio-interface-files.png)

 This is also the place where plots you generate with ggplot2 will be displayed (under the Plots tab). In the Help tab, you can consult the documentation for all R commands and for all commands of any installed R packages.

## Making visualisations with ggplot2

The following instructions are valid for RStudio Cloud. The instructions for RStudio are very similar, the only difference being the loading and saving of files.

<aside>
üîó If you have created a RStudio Cloud account and logged into it, you can access the full project of this tutorial at <a href='https://rstudio.cloud/content/4539381'>rstudio.cloud/content/4539381</a>. Clicking this link will create a temporary copy of the project to your account. To save a permanent copy, click the Save a Permanent Copy button in the top menu in RStudio Cloud.

</aside>

<aside>
üîó The full R script can also be downloaded with the link below. Note that this script loads the data from a CSV file hosted online. You can open this file with RStudio and run it to create the visualisation of this tutorial.

[ggplot-bubble-chart.R](Grammar%20of%20Graphics%20in%20practice%20ggplot2%203d76e378b4bf4c6aa5886f4e622358b3/ggplot-bubble-chart.r)

</aside>

To make visualisations with ggplot2, you need to install the package first. You can do this by clicking on the ‚ÄúPackages‚Äù tab in the pane in the bottom right, then click the ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button and search for ggplot2 in the dialog that opens.

<p class='center'>
<img src='Grammar%20of%20Graphics%20in%20practice%20ggplot2%203d76e378b4bf4c6aa5886f4e622358b3/rstudio-install-ggplot2.png' alt='The "Install packages" dialogue of RStudio, with the ggplot2 package highlighted in the dropdown to search for packages' class='max-400' />
</p>

Select ggplot2 and click install.

Next, you need to load the freshly installed package into your R session. Do this by typing

```r
library(ggplot2)
```

into a new R script (you can open a new R script with File > New file > R script). Run this command by clicking the ‚ÄúRun‚Äù button at the top of the code editor pane.

You are almost ready to make plots with ggplot2. The only thing lacking is the data. Download the data file below and save it on your computer.

[The Upload Files dialogue of RStudio](Grammar%20of%20Graphics%20in%20practice%20Observable%20Plot%207301fc85520e4ef980fd7561ba2acef6/bubble-chart-data.csv)

Next, click the "Upload" button in the Files tab in the bottom right pane, navigate to the file you just downloaded, and upload it (you don‚Äôt need to change the default target directory it will be uploaded to).

<p class='center'>
<img src='Grammar%20of%20Graphics%20in%20practice%20ggplot2%203d76e378b4bf4c6aa5886f4e622358b3/Rstudio-upload-file.png' alt='' class='max-600' />
</p>

After this, the file will be listed in the Files pane. You can now import it by clicking the ‚ÄúImport Dataset‚Äù button in the environment tab. Select ‚ÄúFrom Text (base)‚Äù, select the file you just uploaded and click ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù.

In the next step, you don‚Äôt have to change anything, and you can just click ‚ÄúImport‚Äù.

After this, the data will open in a new tab in the source pane, and the imported data is listed in the environment tab.

![The RStudio interface, with the data of the csv file loaded](Grammar%20of%20Graphics%20in%20practice%20ggplot2%203d76e378b4bf4c6aa5886f4e622358b3/Rstudio-imported-data.png)

If you navigate to the ‚ÄúHistory‚Äù tab in the pane in the top right, you can see the commands RStudio has run:

```r
library(ggplot2)
bubble.chart.data <- read.csv("/cloud/project/bubble-chart-data.csv")
View(bubble.chart.data)
```

With the `read.csv()` command you have loaded the CSV file, and with the `View()` command you have opened a new tab with a preview of the data table.

In order to make the data loading command part of the R script, select the line with the read.csv() command in your History, and click the ‚ÄúTo source‚Äù button above it. This will copy the line to your R script.

To make sure to not to lose your work, save the R script with File > Save and give it a name.

Now you can start building up the visualisation. The main function of the ggplot2 package is the `ggplot()` function. It accepts a `data` argument, with the data to be plotted, and a `mapping` argument to map variables in the data to aesthetics.

```r
ggplot(data = bubble.chart.data, mapping = aes(x = income, y = lifeexp))
```

If you run this command (by setting the cursor on it and click the ‚ÄúRun‚Äù button), a first plot will be generated.

![A chart canvas with the variable lifeexp on the y axis and the variable income on the x axis, but without any data shown](Grammar%20of%20Graphics%20in%20practice%20ggplot2%203d76e378b4bf4c6aa5886f4e622358b3/ggplot-no-geometry.png)

From the axes of this plot you can see that ggplot2 correctly mapped income to the x aesthetic and life expectancy to the y aesthetic. But nothing is drawn yet on the plot. The reason is that the the ggplot code is still missing a specification for what geometries to use in the plot. Let‚Äôs add a point geometry to the plot with `geom_point()`

```r
ggplot(data = bubble.chart.data, mapping = aes(x = income, y = lifeexp)) +
  geom_point()
```

![A scatter plot with black dots, with the variable lifeexp on the y axis and the variable income on the x axis](Grammar%20of%20Graphics%20in%20practice%20ggplot2%203d76e378b4bf4c6aa5886f4e622358b3/ggplot-basic-points.png)

Next, we can add the other aesthetics:

```r
ggplot(data = bubble.chart.data, mapping = aes(
  x = income,
  y = lifeexp,
  size = population,
  colour = continent)) **+
geom_point()**
```

![The same scatter plot as above, but with coloured dots of different sizes](Grammar%20of%20Graphics%20in%20practice%20ggplot2%203d76e378b4bf4c6aa5886f4e622358b3/ggplot-aesthetics.png)

Notice the legends for the population and the continent mappings. Source: Maarten Lambrechts, CC BY SA 4.0

All the aesthetics are in place now, and you can start configuring the scales. In ggplot2 you do this by adding `scale()` functions to the plot. The name of the scale functions is of the format scale_AESTHETIC_SCALETYPE(). For example, to turn the x scale into a logarithmic one, you add a `scale_x_log10()` function to the plot:

```r
ggplot(data = bubble.chart.data, mapping = aes(
    x = income,
    y = lifeexp,
    size = population,
    colour = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10()
```

![The same scatter plot as above, but with a logarithmic x scale](Grammar%20of%20Graphics%20in%20practice%20ggplot2%203d76e378b4bf4c6aa5886f4e622358b3/ggplot-log-scale.png)

Source: Maarten Lambrechts, CC BY SA 4.0

The size of the bubbles is controlled by a size scale. Because we want the area of the bubbles to represent the population of each country, we can add a `scale_size_area()` function. Scale functions accept arguments to configure them. You can make the bubble bigger by setting the maximum area with the `max_size` argument, and you can set the title of the legend for the scale with the `name` argument.

```r
ggplot(data = bubble.chart.data, mapping = aes(
    x = income,
    y = lifeexp,
    size = population,
    colour = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_size_area(max_size = 32, name = "Population")
```

![The same plot as above, but with bigger bubbles](Grammar%20of%20Graphics%20in%20practice%20ggplot2%203d76e378b4bf4c6aa5886f4e622358b3/ggplot-size-scale.png)

Source: Maarten Lambrechts, CC BY SA 4.0

To make the legend a bit more readable, we can express the population numbers in millions, and add a breaks argument to the size scale to set the values of the legend items.

```r
ggplot(data = bubble.chart.data, mapping = aes(
    x = income,
    y = lifeexp,
    size = population/1000000,
    colour = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_size_area(
    max_size = 32,
    name = "Population (millions)",
    breaks = c(10, 100, 500, 1000))
```

![The same plot as above, but the legend for the size of the bubbles now has the title 'Population (millions)', and it shows bubble sizes for 10, 100, 500 and 1000](Grammar%20of%20Graphics%20in%20practice%20ggplot2%203d76e378b4bf4c6aa5886f4e622358b3/ggplot-sizescale-millions.png)

Now you can start working on the styling of the plot. In the original chart, the bubbles have a black outline. To replicate that, you have to change the mapping of the continent variable: it should be mapped to the fill aesthetic instead of to the colour aesthetic. Not all shapes available in  `geom_point()`  have both a colour and fill aesthetic. But shape 21 is a filled circle (all shapes have a number in ggplot2, you can find all the available shapes [in the ggplot2 documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html#sec:shape-spec)).

```r
ggplot(data = bubble.chart.data, mapping = aes(
    x = income,
    y = lifeexp,
    size = population/1000000,
    fill = continent)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_size_area(
    max_size = 32,
    name = "Population (millions)",
    breaks = c(10, 100, 500, 1000))
```

![The same plot as above, but with black outlines bubbles](Grammar%20of%20Graphics%20in%20practice%20ggplot2%203d76e378b4bf4c6aa5886f4e622358b3/ggplot-filled-circles.png)

Source: Maarten Lambrechts, CC BY SA 4.0

For now, the plot is still using the default ggplot2 categorical colour palette for the fill of the circles. Let‚Äôs change that by adding a `scale_fill_manual()` scale and apply custom colours with its `values` argument. You can capitalise the legend title with the `name` argument.

```r
ggplot(data = bubble.chart.data, mapping = aes(
    x = income,
    y = lifeexp,
    size = population/1000000,
    fill = continent)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_size_area(
    max_size = 32,
    name = "Population (millions)",
    breaks = c(10, 100, 500, 1000)) +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("#FF265C", "#FFE700", "#4ED7E9", "#70ED02", "purple"),
    name = "Continent")
```

![The same plot as above, but with different colours](Grammar%20of%20Graphics%20in%20practice%20ggplot2%203d76e378b4bf4c6aa5886f4e622358b3/ggplot-colours.png)

Now it is time for theming. The plot uses the default ggplot2 theme, with its characteristic grey plot background. A more neutral theme that is built into ggplot2 is `theme_minimal()` ([see a list of available built in ggplot2 themes here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html)).

```r
ggplot(data = bubble.chart.data, mapping = aes(
    x = income,
    y = lifeexp,
    size = population/1000000,
    fill = continent)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_size_area(
    max_size = 32,
    name = "Population (millions)",
    breaks = c(10, 100, 500, 1000)) +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("#FF265C", "#FFE700", "#4ED7E9", "#70ED02", "purple"),
    name = "Continent") +
  theme_minimal()
```

![The same plot as above, but with the grey background removed](Grammar%20of%20Graphics%20in%20practice%20ggplot2%203d76e378b4bf4c6aa5886f4e622358b3/ggplot2-theme-minimal.png)

Source: Maarten Lambrechts, CC BY SA 4.0

On top of the theming configuration of `theme_minimal()`, you can add more theming with the `theme()` function. With this function you can edit many elements of the plot ([see the documentation of the ggplot theming for a complete overview](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html)). 

As an example, you can move the legend to the top of the plot, and remove the minor grid lines (the grid lines which don‚Äôt have an axis label). Removing elements in `theme()` is done by setting the elements to `element_blank()`.

```r
ggplot(data = bubble.chart.data, mapping = aes(
    x = income,
    y = lifeexp,
    size = population/1000000,
    fill = continent)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_size_area(
    max_size = 32,
    name = "Population (millions)",
    breaks = c(10, 100, 500, 1000)) +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("#FF265C", "#FFE700", "#4ED7E9", "#70ED02", "purple"),
    name = "Continent") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "top")
```

![The same plot as above, but with the legend on top instead of to the right](Grammar%20of%20Graphics%20in%20practice%20ggplot2%203d76e378b4bf4c6aa5886f4e622358b3/ggplot-theme-custom.png)

Finally, you can make the chart more readable by improving the axis titles and adding the units the values are expressed in. Setting the titles of the x and y axis can be done with `xlab()` and `ylab()` functions. Let‚Äôs also change the number formatting of the x axis labels to be expressed in thousands.

Finally, you can give the plot a title with `ggtitle()`.

```r
ggplot(data = bubble.chart.data, mapping = aes(
    x = income/1000,
    y = lifeexp,
    size = population/1000000,
    fill = continent)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_size_area(
    max_size = 32,
    name = "Population (millions)",
    breaks = c(10, 100, 500, 1000)) +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("#FF265C", "#FFE700", "#4ED7E9", "#70ED02", "purple"),
    name = "Continent") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "top") +
  xlab("Income (GDP/capita, in thousands of dollars)") +
  ylab("Life expectancy (years)") +
  ggtitle("Strong correlation between economic development and life expectancy")
```

![The same plot as above, but now with the axis titles being 'Life expectancy (years)' and 'Income (GDP/capita, in thousands of dollars)'](Grammar%20of%20Graphics%20in%20practice%20ggplot2%203d76e378b4bf4c6aa5886f4e622358b3/ggplot-finished.png)

Source: Maarten Lambrechts, CC BY SA 4.0

Now that the plot is ready, you can save it with the `ggsave()` function. In that function, you need to give the image file a name (the file extension of the filename determines the file format, like .png, .jpg or .pdf) and dimensions by setting the `unit` argument and the `width` and `height` of the image to save.

```r
ggsave(
	filename = "ggplot-bubble-chart.png",
	units = "cm",
	width = 25,
	height = 18)
```

## Extra

Faceting a plot in ggplot2 is done with the `facet_wrap()` function:

```r
ggplot(data = bubble.chart.data, mapping = aes(
    x = income/1000,
    y = lifeexp,
    size = population/1000000,
    fill = continent)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_size_area(
    max_size = 32,
    name = "Population (millions)",
    breaks = c(10, 100, 500, 1000)) +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("#FF265C", "#FFE700", "#4ED7E9", "#70ED02", "purple"),
    name = "Continent") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "top") +
  xlab("Income (GDP/capita, in thousands of dollars)") +
  ylab("Life expectancy (years)") +
  ggtitle("Strong correlation between economic development and life expectancy") +
  facet_wrap(~continent)
```
