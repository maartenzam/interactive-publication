Let‚Äôs have a look at the following tidy table, and try to do some very basic analysis on the data.

| country | year | cases | population |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Belgium | 2020 | 14.444 | 11.522.440 |
| Belgium | 2021 | 14.791 | 11.554.767 |
| Bulgaria | 2020 | 23.128 | 6.916.548 |
| Bulgaria | 2021 | 22.305 | 6.951.482 |
| Czechia | 2020 | 8.610 | 10.494.836 |
| Czechia | 2021 | 8.990 | 10.693.939 |

If you are interested in the cases rate for each year in each country, calculating the rate is a matter of adding a `rate` column, and dividing the `cases` values in each row by the `population` value in the same row (possibly multiplying by 100.000 to get the cases per 100.000 inhabitants). This operation is straightforward in many software tools, including spreadsheet programmes like Microsoft Excel.

<aside>
üîé As a little exercise, try to imagine the steps needed to calculate the rates for every of the untidy versions of the same data table discussed above.
Notice that one of the untidy tables already has a <code>rate</code> column. But this column contains the rates as a string that combines the number of cases and the population number seperated with a ‚Äú/‚Äù character.

Now imagine that you are interested in the total (or average) number of cases over all countries and years. Calculating these aggregate numbers is as easy as taking the sum or the average of the `cases`  column in the tidy data table.

üîé Again, try to imagine the steps needed to calculate these aggregate values from the untidy data tables as an exercise.

Both of the little exercises above illustrate the advantage of working with tidy data: operations like deriving new columns and aggregating data become much easier when the data is tidy.

Tidy data is a prerequisite for making visualisations based on the Grammar of Graphics. The schema below illustrates why. In the Grammar of Graphics, variables in the data are mapped to the visual properties (the aesthetics) of geometrical objects (see <span class='internal-link'>[Overview of the Grammar of Graphics building blocks](gog-building-blocks-overview)</span>).

With untidy data, this direct mapping between columns/variables and aesthetics is not possible: a column could contain multiple values or values for more than one variable, or a variable might be spread over multiple columns. So, with untidy data, making visualisations based on the Grammar of Graphics is not possible: the data needs to be tidied first before it can be used for visualisation.
