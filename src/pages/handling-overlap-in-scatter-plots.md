In the scatter plots shown above, many of the circles representing the data points are overlapping each other. Both charts use the opacity of the circles to show the overlap: because the circles have some transparency, the areas on the chart where there is a lot of overlap have a darker colour than the circles that are not overlapping other circles.

This technique of using transparent circles can be replaced or complemented with giving the circles a white or other light coloured outline.

When the number of data points to show is so high that when using the techniques mentioned above, the scatter plot is still too crowded, the size of the dots can be reduced. When even this does not solve the issue, you could look into binning your scatter plot to create <span class='internal-link'>[high data density scatter plots](data-dense-scatter-plots)</span>.
