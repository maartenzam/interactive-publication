Plotting many observations or time series in a single visualisation can lead to overcrowded charts. One solution to this problem is to create what are called small multiples: little copies of the same chart, arranged in a grid, each containing a subset of the same data.

In the language of the Grammar of Graphics, small multiple charts are produced using **faceting**. In the example above, the `continent` variable is used to facet the plot, and as a result a small plot is created for each continent.

Faceting a plot can lead to a cleaner view on the data, and better comparisons between the values of the facet variable. Important for making comparisons between small multiples is that they <span class='internal-link'>[share the same x and y scales](preserve-scales-for-comparisons)</span>share the same x and y scales. When this is not the case, like in the faceted plot below, comparisons are much harder to make.

Instead of a single facet variable, a plot can also be facetted using 2 variables. In that case, the small multiples are arranged in a grid in which the columns represent the values of the first variable, and the rows the values of the second variable.

In the plot below a data set containing body measurements on penguins is plotted as a scatter plot that maps culmen length to y and and culmen depth to x. The plot is facetted by the sex (columns) and by the species (rows) of the penguins.
