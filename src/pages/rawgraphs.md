Output formats are static (PNG and SVG), and styling options in RAWGraphs are limited. The exported SVG files are meant to be finished in vector editing software like Illustrator. The RAWGraphs website includes a [gallery of charts made with the tool](https://rawgraphs.io/gallery), and a [list of tutorials](https://rawgraphs.io/learning).
