When showing data about people, like in the example above showing arrested people in Hong Kong, visualization designers and data journalists often use design strategies that presumably help the audience relate to those people. The term anthropographics has been recently coined to refer to this practice and the resulting visualizations.

The goal of using more relatable depictions of human beings in data visualisation is to promote social feelings or prosocial behaviour. It is a way to evoke empathy with the subjects of your data visualisation.

The design space of antropographics is very large: humans can be represented in a wide variety of ways.

Anthropographics don’t have to be visual necesarily: revealing some details about a person can already be enough to make an abstract visualisation more relatable.

Below, different properties of anthropographics are discussed and illustrated.

## Granularity

Granularity refers to the extent to which the persons in the visualized dataset are mapped to separate data items – and equivalently, to separate marks on the visualization.

In a visualization with low granularity, each mark corresponds to a group of persons who have one or more attribute values in common.

In a visualization with maximum granularity, each data item corresponds to a single person.

## Specificity

The specificity of a visualization corresponds to how distinctive the entire set of attributes of people in the visualized dataset is. The more the attributes allow to distinguish between data items (either individuals or groups of people) the higher the visualization’s specificity.

In a visualization with **low specificity**, items tend to be visually very similar to each other and most of them cannot be distinguished.

In a visualization with **high specificity**, the attributes in the visualized dataset allow the reader to perfectly distinguish all data items.

## Realism

Realism refers to the degree of resemblance of the visualization’s marks to actual persons.

A visualization with low realism represents people or groups of people using symbolic marks that are non-anthropomorphic, that is, they bear no resemblance with a human. Such marks include dots, bars, abstract glyphs, or shapes that evoke inanimate objects. A visualization with high realism is made of realistic anthropomorphic marks, which closely resemble an actual person.

[Wee People](https://github.com/propublica/weepeople) is a font that renders silhouettes of people, so it has an intermediat level of realism.
