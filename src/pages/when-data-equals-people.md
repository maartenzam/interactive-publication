A lot of data is collected at the personal level. When this data is visualised (leaving a discussion about privacy and ethical issues aside here),  a data point on a chart represents a person directly, with a one-on-one relationship.

In those cases where a data point represents a real person, creating empathy for the people represented and createing engagement with the represented data, can be relatively straightforward. Providing some human details about the persons will already create some form of empathy.

For example, you can show a picture or another visual representation of a person. This can either be a real image, a drawing or a silhouette.
