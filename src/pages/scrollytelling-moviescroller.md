The New York Times article “How a Massive Bomb Came Together in Beirut’s Port contains 2 moviescrollers: the first one starts with aerial imagery of the aftermath of the explosion, but then transitions into a moviescroller of 3D rendering of the scene before the explosion. The second moviescroller explains what is going on in a video of the explosion.
