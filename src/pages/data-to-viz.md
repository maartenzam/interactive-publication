The Data to Viz gallery contains some 40 chart types, which can be browsed as a simple grid list, or as a hierarchy based on the data types needed to construct the charts.

Unique to Data to Viz is that each chart type in the collections not only has  a short description, but also a list with common mistakes associated with each chart type.

All the caveats are also collected on [a dedicated page](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveats.html). But even more interesting is that Data to Viz is actually a portal to 3 mirror sites: each chart type has links to its sister page on

- [r-graph-gallery.com](https://r-graph-gallery.com/), which contains sample code to make the visualisation in R
- [python-graph-gallery](https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/), with Python sample code to produce the chart type
- [d3-graph-gallery](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/), with javascript and D3.js code to make the visualisation
