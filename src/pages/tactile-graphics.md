Braille textbooks sometimes contain tactile graphics: embossed maps, charts, schematic diagrams and geometric figures that can be sensed through touch.

Tactile maps are important for wayfinding in public transport infrastructure for visually impaired people.

Making tactile graphics is an art in itself, and usually involves manual craft. The American Printing House for the Blind has published [a library of templates for good tactile designs](https://imagelibrary.aph.org/portals/aphb/#page/welcome), which also includes some examples of charts.

An attempt to make time series data accessible on refreshable braille displays is [SparkBraille](https://fizzstudio.github.io/sparkbraille/). It uses the cells of the braille display to show a simplified version of a line chart, to get the gist of the trends in the data.

The numbers in the time series are binned into vertical buckets, and each braille cell is used to show 2 binned values. Source: [fizzstudio.github.io/sparkbraille](https://fizzstudio.github.io/sparkbraille/)

SparkBraille is currently only a proof of concept.
