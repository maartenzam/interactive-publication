Pie charts have a bad name in data visualisation. This reputation is partly due to many poorly designed pie charts being published, and suboptimal default settings in popular tools for data visualisation like Excel.

But there is no doubt that other chart types can be more effective as the following example shows. In these 3 pie charts, there is always a smallest and a biggest slice of the pie. In pie charts 1 (left) and 3 (right) all slices have a different size. Can you identify the biggest and smallest slice in each pie?

- If you click the little triangle here on the left, the same data but visualised with a different chart type will be revealed, and you will notice that finding the biggest and smallest category in the data is now much easier.

So pie charts are not very effective if you want your audience to be able to assess proportions effectively. So under what circumstances are pie charts appropriate? Here are some guidelines.

Pie charts are used to show how a total is composed out of its parts. So the parts of the pie should **add up to 100 percent**.

Pies with **more than 5 slices become harder to read**. To limit the number of slices, you can group the smaller slices together in an “other” category.

**Highlighting the most important slice of a pie** can work well.

In the design of the pie, **sort the values**, **start the slices at 12 o’clock** and try to **avoid a separate colour legend** and use direct labelling to name each slice.

The best use case for pie charts is when you want to show that the sum of a couple of the slices of the pie represent more than 50% (or 25 or 75%) of the total. In that case a pie chart can really shine and outperform other chart types.
