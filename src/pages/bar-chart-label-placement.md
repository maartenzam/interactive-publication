Data labels are usually positioned at the end of the bars, because it is the end of the bar where the values should be read from. These labels can be placed inside or outside the bars. When they are placed inside, they can be in white and have some transparency to make them blend in into their bars.

When the labels are placed inside the bars, a solution needs to be provided for small values that lead to labels that do not fit inside the bars.

A common solution is to position the data labels inside the bars, and outside of the bars in the case they do not fit.
