The paper has a handy definitition of what scrollytelling is:

> Scrollytelling refers to a storytelling format in which visual and textual elements appear or change as the reader scrolls through an online article. It is more clearly defined in the negative: when readers scroll, something other than the conventional movement of a document through the viewport happens.
> 

Scrollytelling usually involves a fixed or updating visual that updates as text blocks scroll by.

But other techniques also exist. The paper authors analysed 50 scrollytelling articles, and identified 5 kinds of scrollytelling.

Based on an analysis of the properties of the scrollers in a a collection scrollytelling stories, the graphics team of the Neue Zurcher Zeitung identified 5 types:
