When time series data consist of daily measurements, or when the data can be aggregated into daily values, a **calendar heatmap** can pack a full year of daily measurements into a single, compact visualisation. When the time series data spans multiple years, multiple heatmaps can be created and placed below each other.

Calendar heatmaps can be enriched with bars to show aggregates for weeks and days of the week. This can be really helpful to spot cyclic patterns in the time series.

Calendar heatmaps can also be used to show time series at different time scales. The example below shows a heatmap for hourly data.
