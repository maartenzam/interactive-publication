The narrative power of adding visual and textual annotations is described on the <span class='internal-link'>[visual annotations](tag/visual-annotations)</span> and <span class='internal-link'>[text annotations](tag/text-annotations)</span> pages. The researchers recognised this power by identifying the annotated chart as a separate genre.

Annotated charts will have only a limited amount of surrounding text and use a visualisation as the canvas for the annotations, which are the building blocks of the narrative.
